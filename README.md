# WWDC-A3-Git
    Working with data and code A3 - Scratch project
   I designed my Scratch project includes a storyline of characters ‘Jacinta’ and ‘Flipper’ who wish to explore places internationally, and on their ‘travels’, Jacinta, who is played by the user in the games, partakes in various interactive games. When approaching this project, I wanted to encourage myself to push myself to problem-solve and self-reflect by creating a more complex Scratch project. Hence, I chose to create multiple games within the overarching framework of a story.
